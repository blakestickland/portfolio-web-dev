## AIM:

Junior Software Developer with a desire to utilise my professional experience, background, and new software development skills. Recently completed the _nology Tech Consultancy program full-time boot camp focusing on HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, React, Firestore, Java, and Spring. Prior to this I earned a certificate for Full-Stack Web Development from Monash University with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node.js.

## GOALS:

Engaging the end-user with a balance of clear, focussed design and well implemented data are my aims for each project. My portfolio shows a range of indivdual and group work including Well Me, a wellness tracking solution that logs user results, provides inspirational messages for motivation, shows a graph of weekly progress and gives recipe suggestions based on any user-entered dietry preferences. I am excited to apply my skills as part of a dynamic, quality-driven team to create exceptional sites on the web.
